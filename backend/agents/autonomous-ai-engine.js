# Autonomous Orchestration System - Resilient Deployment
#
# This file contains the main application logic for a self-sufficient
# orchestration system. It has been updated to be resilient to network
# failures and remove the hard-coded "manual intervention" requirement.
#
# The system now attempts to connect to a list of blockchain RPC endpoints.
# If all connections fail, it will enter a retry loop instead of exiting,
# ensuring the application stays alive during temporary network outages.
